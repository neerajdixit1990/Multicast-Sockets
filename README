USER Documentation:
===================
- The complete assignment consists of 2 .C file namely tour.c & arp.c
  and the Makefile and README
- To compile the assignment just run the command 'make' in the assignment
  directory
- To clean the executable files just run the command 'make clean' in the
  assignment directory
- First deploy the the three execulable files arp & tour (Deploy ARP first)
   e.g:
  ~/cse533/deploy_app arp
  ~/cse533/deploy_app tour (NO arguements)
- Then to start a tour from any VM, kill the earlier tour process and start a
  new tour with command line arguements consisting of VM names
 
 
System Documentation:  
==================== 
  1. TOUR:
	 - The tour module is responsible for creating the rt socket, pg socket and invoking ARP resolution
	 - The tour module sends the route traversal packets along the tour path
	 - Every tour module after reception of route traversal packet:
		a) Joins the multicast group
		b) Forwards the packet to next VM via 'rt' socket. The tour module receives all route
		   traversal packets on 'rt' socket
		c) The tour module communicates with ARP via a UNIX domain socket which is type SOCK_STREAM.
		   The ARP module returns the hardware address of the destination node.
		d) After getting hardware address, the tour module sends a PING request packet to the destination
		   through the packet socket
		e) The ping packet is interpreted by the kernel and the PING reply sent is received on
		   the 'pg' socket
		f) If it is the last node in tour, it sends out a multicast message to the multicast address
		g) After reception of multicast message, every node responds to this message by sending a
		   multicast message back. (Each node receives N multicast messages with a tour of N nodes)
	 
  2. ARP:
	 - The ARP module is responsible for doing the ARP resolution for the IP address given by tour module
	 - ARP module listens to UNIX domain socket for ARP resolution request from tour module
	 - After reception of request for ARP resolution, it checks ARP cache for availability of HW address
	   of destination. If present, a reply is sent to tour module immediately.
	 - If HW address is not available, it sends a ARP request to the broadcast MAC address (ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff)
	 - All machines receiving ARP request update their ARP cache
	 - All the nodes in network receive this ARP request and the intended node replies with ARP reply
	 - The machine receiving the ARP reply updates its ARP cache and responds to the tour module via the
	   UNIX domain socket
	 
	 
Test Documentation:
=====================
1) The program is tested for all input values (as per assignment requirements)
2) Appropriate print statements are added to better understand the working of assignment
